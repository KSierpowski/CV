                I tried to get the most out of each job. In my opinion, every job develops. I gained a lot of soft skills in previous jobs. 
                Teamwork, focus on the goal, good organization of working time. Despite the home office and infrequent meetings with people from the team, we still
                have great contact with many people.

                    <p>In my previous professional role, I was mainly involved in acquiring, supporting and maintaining positive customer relationships, combining this
                        with sales activity. As part of my involvement with Oferteo, at one point I achieved an average target realization of 150%. In addition, 
                        I systematically I participated in various training courses in the art of selling, which contributed to the to further improve my skills in 
                        the area of sales.</p>

                    <p>I handled complex shipping and customer service both domestically and internationally. In addition, I served in a training role for new employees, 
                        and on an exceptional basis handled UV printers. Humorously stating, one could say that I was a "one-man army" in the company. 
                        Despite the company's small size, my multitasking and efficiency at work were enthusiastically received, resulting in a quick promotion. 
                        During this career path, I learned effective time management and how to efficiently perform multiple tasks simultaneously.</p>

                    <p>In the context of the company's highly client-centric policy, I excelled in developing strong communication skills. This played a key role in achieving 
                        a top-three quarterly score at the national level. Not only did I effectively reach my goals, but I also had the opportunity to support my colleagues. 
                        This experience taught me that, beyond individual success, actively contributing to a positive work environment and supporting the team are equally important.</p>
