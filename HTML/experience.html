                I tried to get the most out of each job, and I don't mean stuffs. In my opinion, every job develops. I gained a lot of soft skills in previous jobs. 
                Teamwork, focus on the goal, good organization of working time. Despite the home office and infrequent meetings with people from the team, we still
                have great contact with many people.

                    <p>The work mainly consisted of acquiring, supporting and maintaining good relationships with customers, 
                        in addition to a sales component. At Oferteo, I can boast several months of average target realization of 150%. 
                        During this time, I also participated in many trainings related to the art of sales.</p>

                    <p>I was in charge of shipping and customer service in Poland and abroad, training new employees and, in special circumstances, 
                        operating UV printers. To put it jokingly, I was a one-man army in this company. Thanks to this, I was quickly promoted. 
                        I learned to manage my time well and multitasking is not a problem for me.</p>

                    <p>Thanks to the company's very pro-client policy, I developed the art of dialogue very well. Very quickly 
                        I was able to achieve TOP 3 quarterly results nationwide. By reaching my target quickly, I had time to help my colleagues.</p>
